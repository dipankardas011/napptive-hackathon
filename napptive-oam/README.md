# Redis with Go Gin

> Redis is an open-source, in-memory data structure store that is used as a distributed, in-memory key-value database, cache, message broker, and queue. Redis provides various data structures, such as strings, lists, maps, sets, sorted sets, HyperLogLogs, bitmaps, streams, and spatial indices

Deploy the application and connect to it using `redis-0.redis-headless:6379` from other applications or components in the same environment.

And a Go gin server is running for handling the requests and is exposed via ingress
